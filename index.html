Welcome to freesurfer_statsurf_display.

freesurfer_statsurf_display contains a collection of scripts to display
Freesurfer surfaces with its cortical parcellations coloured for rapid figure generation in MATLAB.

<P>Freesurfer 6 produces cortical parcellations. This collection of functions displays
the average surfaces and colours the regions of the cortical parcellations as a figure in MATLAB. The following
colouring schemes are supported:
<UL>
<LI>freesurfer RGB values
<LI><I>p</I>-values, with sign determined by corresponding test statistic values
<LI>effect sizes
<LI>r squared
<LI>arbitrary scalars
</UL>

<P> The folowing parcellation schemes are supported:
<UL>
<LI><B>Desikan-Killiany</B>: 
<LI><B>Desikan-Killiany-Tourville</B>:
<LI><B>Destrieux</B>: 

For the Desikan-Killiany and Desikan-Killiany-Tourville schemes, the highlighted regions are annotated
with either their full names or shortened names. Highlighted regions will either have significant <I>p</I>-values
for the other plots, user-specified masks can be supplied to select regions to colour and annotate.

<P>The plots are customisable with options to change the title, legend name, group names (p-value plot).
